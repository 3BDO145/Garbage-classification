![brain + circuit v_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db5e7b40-9dbc-4609-9a8f-75ce7823ba1b)

This repository contains implementations of the following deep learning architectures:
---
### DenseNet

DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer, promoting feature reuse and efficient learning.

 - **Advantages**: Reduces the number of parameters while maintaining high accuracy.

### Xception

Xception uses depthwise separable convolutions for efficient and powerful feature extraction.

 - **Advantages**: Combines efficiency with state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks.

### ResNet50

ResNet50 employs residual connections, allowing very deep networks to train effectively.

 - **Advantages**: Excellent performance on large-scale datasets with manageable computational requirements.

### ResNet18

ResNet18 is a smaller version of ResNet, designed for lightweight applications.

 - **Advantages**: Ideal for resource-constrained environments or smaller datasets.

**Each model is implemented to be easily customizable for your tasks. Let us know if you have any questions or need additional features!**
